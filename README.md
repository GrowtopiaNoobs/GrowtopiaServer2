# Growtopia Server 2 [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9ofy5h4f4xhoncip?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GrowtopiaNoobs/growtopiaserver2)

This code has been tested to compile under Ubuntu 18.04 with CLion 19.3. Windows build should work with Visual Studio, but it isn't tested.

All functionality of server should be added via modules. Modules should be placed into directory `modules`, which should be placed into same directory as server. Modules should be created using [module API](https://github.com/GrowtopiaNoobs/GrowtopiaServer2-Module).

This project has been published under GNU AFFERO GPL license, so you need to **publish whole source code and citate orginal authors name, even if you are using your server as service**!
